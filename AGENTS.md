# AGENTS.md

## Issues-first workflow (mandatory)

**No ticket, no workee.** Do not implement features or bugfixes requested in chat until a tracking GitHub Issue exists.

| Request in chat | Agent action |
|-----------------|--------------|
| New feature | Create issue (`[feat]: …`) via `gh issue create`, then branch |
| Bug / regression | Create issue (`[bug]: …`), then branch |
| Question / explanation only | Answer; no issue required |
| Docs typo (one line) | Fix directly; issue optional |

Before writing implementation code:

1. Confirm repo has a GitHub remote and `gh` auth for the owning identity (**heavygee**).
2. Open or find the issue; note the number.
3. Branch name should include the issue number when practical (`feat/123-short-name`).
4. PR body must include `Fixes #N`.

**Exceptions** (no issue required):

- Operator explicitly says "skip issue" or "no ticket".
- One-line typos, comment-only edits, or doc fixes with no behavior change.
- Active production incident when the operator declares hotfix mode.

## Scope

Public HeavyGee Jellyfin plugin. Deeplink receiver lives in `introVRt-Lounge/vrchat-jellyfin` (`/item/:id`). Coordinate contract changes with that repo before breaking URLs.
